* Compile and run "offline/offline.ml" (warning, this uses a lot of memory)

  ocamlopt offline.ml -o offline
  > maps.lst
  ./offline

* Format of maps.lst:

  - THM1 THM2   map HOL Light THM1 to Isabelle/HOL THM2 and forget its deps
  - THM -       do not record THM and make sure it is not used (its deps must be mapped)
  - THM         the definition of constant/type is mapped in Isabelle/HOL, so forget
                its deps and look its map up when defining (may fail at import time)

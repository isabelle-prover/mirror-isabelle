  The definition of the selection algorithm is complicated somewhat by the fact that its
  termination is contingent on its correctness: if the first recursive call were to return an
  element for \<open>x\<close> that is e.g. smaller than all list elements, the algorithm would not terminate.

  Therefore, we first prove partial correctness, then termination, and then combine the two
  to obtain total correctness.

text\<open>Heap update \<open>p^.h := e\<close> is now guarded against \<^term>\<open>p\<close>
being Null. However, \<^term>\<open>p\<close> may still be illegal,
e.g. uninitialized or dangling. To guard against that, one needs a
more detailed model of the heap where allocated and free addresses are
distinguished, e.g. by making the heap a map, or by carrying the set
of free addresses around. This is needed anyway as soon as we want to
reason about storage allocation/deallocation.\<close>

subsubsection \<open>List comprehension\<close>

text\<open>Input syntax for Haskell-like list comprehension notation.
Typical example: \<open>[(x,y). x \<leftarrow> xs, y \<leftarrow> ys, x \<noteq> y]\<close>,
the list of all pairs of distinct elements from \<open>xs\<close> and \<open>ys\<close>.
The syntax is as in Haskell, except that \<open>|\<close> becomes a dot
(like in Isabelle's set comprehension): \<open>[e. x \<leftarrow> xs, \<dots>]\<close> rather than
\verb![e| x <- xs, ...]!.

The qualifiers after the dot are
\begin{description}
\item[generators] \<open>p \<leftarrow> xs\<close>,
 where \<open>p\<close> is a pattern and \<open>xs\<close> an expression of list type, or
\item[guards] \<open>b\<close>, where \<open>b\<close> is a boolean expression.
%\item[local bindings] @ {text"let x = e"}.
\end{description}

Just like in Haskell, list comprehension is just a shorthand. To avoid
misunderstandings, the translation into desugared form is not reversed
upon output. Note that the translation of \<open>[e. x \<leftarrow> xs]\<close> is
optmized to \<^term>\<open>map (%x. e) xs\<close>.

It is easy to write short list comprehensions which stand for complex
expressions. During proofs, they may become unreadable (and
mangled). In such cases it can be advisable to introduce separate
definitions for the list comprehensions in question.\<close>

text\<open>
  This function maps (finite) linearly ordered sets to sorted lists.
  The linear order is obtained by a key function that maps the elements of the set to a type
  that is linearly ordered.
  Warning: in most cases it is not a good idea to convert from
  sets to lists but one should convert in the other direction (via \<^const>\<open>set\<close>).

  Note: this is a generalisation of the older \<open>sorted_list_of_set\<close> that is obtained by setting
  the key function to the identity. Consequently, new theorems should be added to the locale
  below. They should also be aliased to more convenient names for use with \<open>sorted_list_of_set\<close>
  as seen further below.
